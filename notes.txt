* Your game must have a main.py file! If you have it named to 
something like game.py hange it to main.py

* If it doesn't detect pygbag you can try it like this:
python -m pygbag

* Your project folder name cannot contain any spaces if it does have spaces you can convert them to underscores instead

* Do not use .wav files for web, convert them to .ogg instead, If you want to use 
.wav for desktop you can do this:
if sys.platform == "emscripten":
    sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("sound.ogg)
else: #desktop
    sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("sound.wav")

* VSCode might think that sys.platform == "emscripten" is not a real thing but 
it is, its just that vscode doesnt know about this yet

* This is still early in development so expect bugs

* If you have any problems you can go run the game with http://localhost:8000/#debug
which gives you a debug mode

* You can also go to pygame's discord server and go to pygame-web channel

* If you want to get rid of "This Page is asking you to leave
- information you've entered may not be saved" question when closing the tab in browsers
you can add this:
if sys.platform == "emscripten":
    import platform
    platform.window.onbeforeunload = None

* When giving extra arguments give them in the middle, not the start or the end:
pygbag --archive [Folder] == correct
pygbag [Folder] --archive == error

You can change the port by adding this argument:
--port [number]
